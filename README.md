# Examples for the ContextConfidentiality Model

Case studies applied to the context confidentiality metamodel. So far following case studies are investigated:
* TravelPlanner
* Cloud Scenario

## Attacker Access Propagation
* Scenarios are stored for each case study in Attacker_Propagation_Accuracy
* contains for each scenario 1-10 a folder with:
    * context model
    * attacker model
    * Kamp configuration model
* A scenario can be executed by selecting in the attacker analysis launch configuration insider and the scenario models
* for the system models the models in the root folder of the case study are used
* the results for the efforct calculation can also be found in the folder

## Scenario Analysis
* only for the travelplanner case study
* in the folder Scenarios for each scenario exits a context file
* for executing a scenario choose one context file and the system files from the root folder
